# Grade Calculator App 🧮✖️➗➕➖🟰
This project is a **Grade Calculator App** designed for calculating individual assignment marks and averages for three students. Each student can input their assignment scores, and the app computes both individual assignment percentages and overall averages. It also provides functionality to reset the inputs and calculate the average for the entire class. The project is styled with CSS and uses JavaScript for dynamic calculations. As long as the project is a team project, each student form has its own logic and coding style. This repository offers three different ways to approach this project.
